This project allows anyone to upload a video file and be presented with a transcript and extracted questions & answers. The target user is a sales executive that wants to look back at questions asked during a call with a prospect/customer. [Here](https://connorbrereton-sales-insights-summarizer-4owrfp.streamlit.app/) is a link to a live demo if you don't want to deploy locally.

## Roadmap

- Change color scheme to match AssemblyAI.
- Breakdown of speakers using Assembly's Speaker Diarization.
- Dockerize the application to avoid all dependency management.
- Remove filler words from Q&A - Breakdown.
- Use profanity filtering to see if prospect/rep used profanity during the call.
- Add webhooks to avoid using temporary variables to manage state within the application.
